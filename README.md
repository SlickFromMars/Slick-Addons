# Slick Addons - A Quality Of Life Haxelib

![](https://github.com/SlickFromMars/Slick-Addons/blob/nightly/include/images/SLICK_LOGO_SMALL.png)

## Features

* An amazing dynamic pathing system!!!
* Semantic versioning interpretation
* Cross platform options for everyday functions
* Attached Sprites
* Cool transitions for your transitioning needs

## Installation and Setup

Run these two commands in order to automatically setup this library, as well as update/install all recommended libraries.
This can substitute for the installation of the libraries needed for FNF, it does cover all of them.

```shell
haxelib install slick_addons
haxelib run slick_addons
```

Anytime that you run `haxelib run slick_addons` it will automatically update all of the libraries that are installed, including itself.
